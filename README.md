# Enkelt JS

Enkelt JS provides extremely useful Javascript functions I use frequently.

Each file contains a single function, and the file name matches the function name. Each function is exported as a module, so you can pick what you need. The majority of the functions do not depend on other Enkelt JS modules.

In most cases, it is enough to know what a function does from its name, but most functions are also well commented.

Simple!
