# Enkelt JS
 Enkelt JS provides extremely useful Javascript functions I use frequently.   Each file contains a single function, and the file name matches the function name. Each function is exported as a module, so you can pick what you need. The majority of the functions do not depend on other Enkelt JS modules.   Simple!
